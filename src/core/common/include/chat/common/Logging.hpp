/**
 * @brief Contains all logging functionality.
 *
 * @details Log entries are outputted to a file with a specific format in a
 * thread-safe manner.
 *
 * By default, logging is outputted to @c std::cout. This behavior can be
 * changed to using files instead by using @c enableLoggingToFile(). Using
 * @c disableLoggingToFile() reverts the behavior to the default behavior.
 *
 * A severity is needed when creating a log entry. The severity only determines
 * the string value for the severity column in the log entry. However, log
 * entries with a debug severity will only log if debug logging is enabled;
 * otherwise, the log entry is elided at compile-time.
 *
 * In order to log objects, use the `LOG()` or `LOG_X()` macros followed by a
 * sequence of insertion operators (`operator<<`). The object following the
 * insertion operator must have an overload for `operator<<` with an
 * `std::ostream`.
